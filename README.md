# Drug-Discovery-Using-DQN
This project aims to explore the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the generation of novel drug-like molecules. By treating molecule construction as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), an RL agent can learn how to sequentially add molecular fragments to construct valid, drug-like compounds.
